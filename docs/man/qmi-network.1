Notes:
.IP
1) [DEVICE] is given as the full path to the cdc\-wdm character
device, e.g.:
.IP
\fI\,/dev/cdc\-wdm0\/\fP
.IP
2) The qmi\-network script requires a profile to work. Unless
explicitly specified with `\-\-profile', the file is assumed to
be available in the following path:
.IP
\fI\,/etc/qmi\-network.conf\/\fP
.IP
3) The APN to use should be configured in the profile, in the
following way (e.g. assuming APN is called 'internet'):
.IP
APN=internet
.IP
4) Optional APN user/password strings may be given in the following
way:
.IP
APN_USER=user
APN_PASS=password
.IP
5) If you want to instruct the qmi\-network script to use the
qmi\-proxy setup, you can do so by configuring the following line
in the profile:
.IP
PROXY=yes
.IP
6) Once the qmi\-network script reports a successful connection
you still need to run a DHCP client on the associated WWAN network
interface.
