 * Build now looks for the correct python provider in the system during
   configure.

 * New services:
   ** New 'QoS' (Quality of Service) service, with some minimal initial
      implementation to support flow/network status querying. Additionally,
      some Sierra-specific commands are also implemented that allow querying

   ** Fixed '--uim-set-pin-protection', '--uim-verify-pin", "--uim-unblock-pin",
      and '--uim-change-pin', so that a dummy application identifier is always
      used.
   ** Updated so that all commands work even through QMI over MBIM, even if
      indications are required to complete the command (e.g. most PDC and LOC
      commands).

 * qmi-network:
   ** Avoid creating invalid --wds-start-network when APN is not set.

Overview of changes in libqmi 1.18.0
----------------------------------------

The full list of new features include:

 * libqmi:
   ** Implemented support for vendor-specific commands through a new
      qmi_device_command_full() operation and a new QmiMessageContext type. The
      original qmi_device_command() is flagged as deprecated.
   ** New 'QMI_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_AUTO' flag in qmi_device_open() which allows
      automatic detection of the underlying protocol in a cdc-wdm device (either
      QMI or MBIM) and transparently uses it based on that.
   ** New qmi_device_close_async() operation, which allows closing a QmiDevice
      asynchronously (especially important when closing devices running QMI over
      MBIM, as this operation requires MBIM protocol cleanups). The original
      qmi_device_close() is flagged as deprecated.
   ** Fixed QmiWmsCdmaCauseCode enum names, and provided a compatibility layer
      keeping the old names (flagged as deprecated) to avoid breaking API.

 * qmi-firmware-update:
   ** This is a completely new tool that allows upgrading firmware in (at least)
      Sierra Wireless devices with MDM9200, MDM9x15 or MDM9x30 chipsets. Run the
      tool with --help and --help-examples to get more information on how to use
      it.

 * qmicli:
   ** The CLI no longer requires the '--device-open-mbim' explicit option when
      opening QMI capable MBIM devices, the automatic detection of QMI over MBIM

   ** If running in MBIM mode, enable MBIM logs and traces.
   ** By default the QmiDevice will be closed before exiting, e.g. so that the
      MBIM session is also closed.

 * docs:
   ** Updated the documentation so that each QMI message and each TLV specifies
      in which libqmi version it was introduced, using "since:" tags in the QMI
      message databases.
   ** Added indices for new symbols introduced in the major libqmi releases, as
      well as for symbols flagged as deprecated.

Overview of changes in libqmi 1.16.0
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-mbim-qmux' option during configure, which enables the support
  for using an MBIM control device as transport for the QMI messages, only if
  the MBIM device implements the "QMI service". This setting is automatically
  enabled if libmbim >= 1.14.0 is found in the system, and can be explicitly
  disabled with `--disable-mbim-qmux'.

* New request/responses:

     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_current_code.
  ** qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_new
     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_new_code.
  ** qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_current
     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_current_code.
  ** qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_new
     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_new_code.
  ** QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_VAILABLE was renamed to
     QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_AVAILABLE.

  ** ECIO value in ECIO List array type in "NAS Get Signal Strenght" is given as
     unsigned.
  ** QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_AVAILABLE enum name was fixed.

* The library and tools now support working with modems which only implement raw
  IP (i.e. no ethernet headers) in the WWAN interface. This relies on the kernel
  to expose '/sys/class/net/<WWAN>/qmi/raw_ip' sysfs files for each WWAN network
  interface (available since Linux 4.5-rc1).

* New initial support for the 'Voice' service.

* New request/responses:
  ** wms: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** wds: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.

  ** voice: new "Dial Call" request/response.
  ** voice: new "End Call" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Answer Call" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Get Config" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.

* New indications:
  ** wms: new "SMSC Address" indication.
  ** pds: new "GPS Ready" indication.
  ** wds: new "Packet Service Status" indication.

* New TLVs supported in existing messages:
  ** wds: support "UMTS Granted QoS" TLV in 'Get Current Settings'.
  ** nas: support "Home Network 3GPP MNC" in "Get Home Network" to know whether
     MNC is 2 or 3 digits.

* The qmicli tool has been updated with several new functionalities:
  ** New '--get-wwan-iface' command line option to allow querying which is the
     WWAN interface associated with a given /dev/cdc-wdm device.
  ** New '--wds-get-current-settings' command line option to query the current
     settings in the WDS service.
  ** New '--get-expected-data-format' and '--set-expected-data-format' actions
     to get or set the data format expected by the kernel.
  ** LTE band descriptions are now printed along with the EARFCN.
  ** Updated '--wds-start-network' arguments to allow specifying "key=value"
     pairs. The old legacy "[(APN),(PAP|CHAP|BOTH),(Username),(Password)]"
     format is kept as valid for backwards compatibility, although it should be
     assumed deprecated.
  ** Updated '--wds-start/stop-network' to allow autoconnect settings, and 3GPP
     or 3GPP2 profile parameters.

* The qmi-network helper script has been updated with several new features:
  ** Allow running with the qmi-proxy.
  ** Allow running qmi-network with multiple devices at the same time.
  ** Automatic link layer protocol update before connecting.
  ** Allow specifying APN user/password.

* Added command completion support in qmicli.

The following features which were backported to 1.12.x releases are also present
in libqmi 1.14.0:

* New request/responses:
  ** dms: new "Set FCC Authentication" request/response.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.12.0
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-qmi-username' option during configure, which allows specifying
  which will be the user owning the /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all QMI
  modems (udev rules are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
  used, the qmi-proxy will only allow connections from processes running by the
  specified user or by the root user.

* New TLV builder and reader API, which is much more strict and secure. The
  autogenerated code will no longer first check if there is enough space
  available in the output message buffer and then write the parsed contents.
  Instead, the new reader API will be used, which is able to check for the
  expected size directly before writing in the buffer.

* New unit tests to check messages built by the libqmi-glib library, using a
  fake proxy. In order to support these, the QmiDevice has two new properties:
  ** "device-no-file-check": instructs the QmiDevice to avoid checking if the
     specified file exists.
  ** "device-proxy-path": specifies a custom abstract socket path for the
     QmiProxy, to avoid using the default one.

* New A-GPS support in the PDS service:
  ** pds: added "Get Default Tracking Session" request/response
  ** pds: added "Set Default Tracking Session" request/response
  ** pds: added "Get AGPS Config" request/response
  ** pds: added "Set AGPS Config" request/response

* Updated minumum available version of several messages:
  ** dms: "UIM Get IMSI" seems to be available in DMS 1.1 already
  ** dms: "UIM Get ICCID" seems to be available in DMS 1.1 already

* Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
  ** Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
  ** Fix bashisms in the qmi-network script.
  ** Fix qmi_message_set_transaction_id() in non-CTL messages.
  ** Fix segfault due to race condition in the QmiProxy.
  ** Fixed printing contents of structs with fixed sized strings in qmi-codegen.
